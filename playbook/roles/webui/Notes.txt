language should probably be JS

log any config changes to syslog
- user set from authentication as X-User header (by nginx)

basic components:
- configuration pages
  - load config-files (YAML) from /etc/opn-cc/config
  - parse to/from forms
  - update YAML files on config change
  - firewall-config might be challenging
    - multiple services on dynamic scopes (all/groups/hosts)

- status pages
  - check config
    - opt-in/-out
    - storage period/history (days)
    - checkin intervals (sec)
  - PUSH STATI TO SYSLOG AND USE GRAYLOG INSTEAD:
    - see current stati
    - history view (with graphs?)

- see last config changes
  - USE VCS WebUI instead
